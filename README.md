# Chapter Listings of the Quran

This app illustrates the working of `Redux` with `React` following from Stephen Grider tutorials in Udacity.

The app lists chapters of the Quran with a select button against each chapter. When clicking on each chapter a detail is presented on a panel or card next to it. 

## install redux and react-redux library

```
yarn add redux react-redux
```
